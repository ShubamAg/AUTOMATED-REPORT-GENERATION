## Task Discription 

The second task involved building a data analysis and reporting pipeline in Python. I was given a CSV file containing product sales data. My job was to read and analyze this data and generate a PDF report using libraries like FPDF.

The script performs the following operations:

Reads a CSV file with product information.

Analyzes the data to find top products, customers, and categories.

Summarizes key metrics like total records, most sold products, and categories.

Uses FPDF to create a well-structured and styled PDF report with headers, fonts, page borders, and a full table displaying the data.

One of the challenges was rendering special characters and long text without overlapping, which I solved by adjusting column widths and encoding settings. I also added custom fonts, page borders, and structured layouts to make the report visually appealing.

This task helped me learn:

File handling and data analysis using pandas.

PDF generation and customization with FPDF.

Creating professional reports directly from code â€” a useful skill for automating business insights.
